# Car-Price-Prediction
A model is used to predict the price of a used car should be developed in order to assess its value based on a variety of characteristics. Several factors affect the price of a used car, such as company, model, year, transmission, distance driven, fuel type, seller type, and owner type.

## Problem Statement:
A used car dealership specializes in selling cars from various brands. They would like to know if the mileage of these cars is a good predictor of their sale prices, and if the slopes and intercepts differ when comparing mileage and price for different brands of cars. What other factors might play a role and how in deciding the price that a customer might be willing to pay. As a data expert, the company relies on your expert analysis and recommendations to increase their profitability by setting the right pricing for their car sales business, such that it delights the customers and gains the company positive feedback/reviews so that their traction in the market increases and they can become one of the key players.
